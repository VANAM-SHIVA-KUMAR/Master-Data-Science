5 Most Important Data Structures that are asked in interviews.

- Heap Data Structure
- Binary Tree
- Stacks and Queues
- Graphs
- Hashmaps
----------------------------------------------------------------
These are top 5 data structures and algorithms projects with ready-to-use source code, allowing you to dive deep into the world of DSA 💪🏻

•Project 1: Snakes Game (Arrays)

The Snakes Game project is a classic implementation of the popular game
Snake.

This project allows you to understand the concepts of arrays, loops, and conditional statements. You can further enhance the game by incorporating additional features such as score tracking and power-ups.

•Project 2: Cash Flow Minimizer (Graphs/ Multisets/Heaps)

The Cash Flow Minimizer project involves solving a cash flow optimization problem using graphs, multisets, and heaps. Given a set of transactions among a group of people, the objective is to minimize the total number of transactions required to settle all debts

•Project 3: Sudoku Solver (Backtracking)

The Sudoku Solver project aims to solve the popular Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. This project allows you to understand the backtracking algorithm, which is widely used in solving constraint satisfaction problems.

•Project 4: File Zipper (Greedy Huffman
Encoder)

The File Zipper project focuses on implementing a file compression utility using the Greedy Huffman encoding algorithm. This project provides a practical application of the greedy algorithm and helps you understand the trade-offs between
compression ratio and execution time.

•Project 5: Map Navigator (Dijkstra’s
Algorithm)

The Map Navigator project aims to develop a navigation system using Dijkstra’s algorithm. It involves finding the shortest path between two locations on a map, considering factors such as distance and traffic.
